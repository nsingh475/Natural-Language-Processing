# Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) ia a branch of  artificial intelligence which is concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistics, machine learning, and deep learning models. 


#### NLP Algorithms
There are two main algorithms to solve NLP problems:
1. A rule-based approach - Rule-based systems rely on hand-crafted grammatical rules that need to be created by experts in linguistics, or knowledge engineers. 
2. Machine learning algorithms - Machine learning models, on the other hand, are based on statistical methods and learn to perform tasks after being fed examples (training data).

The biggest advantage of machine learning algorithms is their ability to learn on their own. We don’t need to define manual rules – instead machines learn from previous data to make predictions on their own, allowing for more flexibility.


#### Challanges to NLP
1. Contextual words and phrases and homonyms
2. Synonyms
3. Irony and sarcasm
4. Ambiguity
5. Errors in text or speech
6. Colloquialisms and slang
7. Domain-specific language


#### Advantages of NLP
1. It can be used to perform large-scale analysis
2. It gives a more objective and accurate analysis
3. It can be used to streamline processes and reduce costs


#### Applications of NLP
Following are some of the applications of natural language processing:
1. Spam detection
2. Machine Translation
3. Virtual agents and chatbots
4. Social media sentiment analysis
5. ext summarization


#### NLP pre-processing tasks
All the text data available to us over the internet is usually unstructured and it cannot be directly used. The text data is converted to a usable and meaningful form by the following pre-processing steps:
1. Tokenization - It breaks down text into smaller semantic units or single clauses.
2. Part-of-speech-tagging - It refers to marking up words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, etc.
3. Stemming and lemmatization - It involves standardizing words by reducing them to their root forms.
4. Stop word removal - It includes filtering out common words that add little or no unique information (Eg: at, to, a, the).


#### Taks in NLP
Some of the NLP tasks include the following:
1. Speech Recognition - It is the task of converting voice data into text data.
2. Part of speech tagging - It is a process of determining the part of speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context.
3. Word sense disambiguation - It is the selection of meaning of a word with multiple meanings that makes the most sense in the given context. 
4. Named entity recognition - It identifies words or phrases as useful entities such as person, place, location etc.
5. Co-reference resolution - It is a task of identifying if and when two words refer to the same entity.
6. Sentiment analysis - It attempts to extract attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, suspicion from text
7. Natural language generation - It is a task of putting structured information into human language.
