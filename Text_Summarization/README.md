# Text Summarization

Text summarization refers to the task of reducing the size of a long text documents without loosing the important and essential information.

There are two major text summarization approaches:
1. abstractive 
2. extractive 

Extractive summarization extracts the most important and meaningful sentences from the text document and forms a summary. On the other hand, abstractive summarization selects words on the basis of semantic understanding, and even includes those words which do not appear in the original text.
