####  Project implementation and workflow
Following are the subtasks:
1. Importing libraries
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
4. Naive Bayes Model
5. Highlighting shortcomings of model and implementing small changes to improve performance
6. Using Subwords - use advanced NLP techniques to improve model performance and address class imbalance
7. Testing on unseen data

In this project, Sentences will be classified into one of Slovak, Czech, and English using Naive Bayes
